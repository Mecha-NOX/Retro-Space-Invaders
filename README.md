# **Space Invaders**

*Classic Arcade Shooter | Developed in Raylib C++*

---

## **Overview**

*Space Invaders* is a modern recreation of the classic arcade shooter, where players must defend the Earth from waves of alien invaders. Developed in C++ using Raylib, this project showcases my ability to implement AI, create responsive player movement, and design engaging shooting mechanics.

## **Features**

- **Classic Space Shooter Gameplay**   
Players control a spaceship that can move left and right, shooting at descending aliens.

- **Alien AI**   
Aliens move in formations and gradually increase their speed as they descend toward the player. If they reach the bottom of the screen, they will attack the player's base.

- **Projectile Mechanics**   
Players fire bullets that hit enemies, destroying them. Each enemy destroyed increases the player's score.

- **Simple User Interface**   
Displays score and player lives, providing feedback to the player.
